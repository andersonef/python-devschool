# Practicing Python

## DevSchool

Devschool is a project I use to practice when learning a new language. 
It is a text-interface program which allows you to manage students, their notes and their class presence.

## Running
Just clone this repository and run main.py script, this way:

    git clone git@github.com/andersonef/python-devschool
    cd python-devschool
    python3 main.py
